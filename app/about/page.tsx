Our products do not contain harmful chemicals like added Parabens, Petrolatum, Mineral Oils, Propylene Glycol or Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. Our products are made with fresh fruit pulps, plants and exotic spices. This makes them incredibly rich in nutrients, so they are not only the healthiest choice for you, but also the most effective, results-oriented collection around. Vitamins are captured in their all-natural fresh base, offering dramatic results as actual seeds, pulps and peels impart regenerative and healing powers that only nature can produce.
